# Review

In this review exercise, you will implement a series of functions and test them via the following command in your terminal:

```
python test_[function name].py
```

So for example, if you wanted to test the `remove_domain` function, you would run:

```
python test_remove_domain.py
```

Keep implementing and testing your code until all assertions return as `True`. Additionally for each function, write a docstring to describe what this function will do, which arguments it will take, and what its return value will be. Keep in mind that you will also be using defensive guards in your functions as well.

The first docstring is implemented as an example. This will not be pushed to GitHub or submitted to Canvas.
